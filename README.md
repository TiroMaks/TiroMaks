## Hi, I'm TiroMaks!

I have been interested in programming and researching new technologies for a long time. At the moment I am:
- Learning programming languages such as Python, C# and Kotlin
- I plan to start learning Java in the future
- I use Github to save my projects and I can work with them anywhere.
- In the future, I may even release my project to the public

I am studying Backend because I am interested in it, as well as because I know Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) to become a FullStack programmer

I am currently studying to be a programmer.
